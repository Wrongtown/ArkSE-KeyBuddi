# ArkSE-KeyBuddy
Cruise control for Ark:SE


## How to use
Download the repository or if you prefer just the [../KeyBuddy-Ark/KeyBuddy - ARK.exe](https://github.com/Wrongtown/ArkSE-QOL/blob/main/KeyBuddy-Ark/KeyBuddy%20-%20ARK.exe) executable.

Ideally save that .exe in a folder of its own and run the .exe

The **About** page of the application is the best place to find up to date information of the features available.
