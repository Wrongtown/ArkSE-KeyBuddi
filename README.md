# ArkSE-KeyBuddi
Cruise control for Ark:SE


## How to use
Download the repository or if you prefer just the [../KeyBuddi-Ark/KeyBuddi - ARK.exe](https://github.com/Wrongtown/ArkSE-KeyBuddi/blob/main/KeyBuddi-Ark/KeyBuddi%20-%20ARK.exe) executable.

Ideally save that .exe in a folder of its own and run the .exe

The **About** page of the application is the best place to find up to date information of the features available.
